URL Next Plus
_____________

URL Next Plus finds the next page link and lets you increment numbers in a
URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or basically any
website that keeps its URLs organized sequentially. It's similar to the FireFox
URL Flipper extension, and you can use shortcut keys and mouse buttons.
