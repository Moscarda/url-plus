URL Next Plus
_____________

URL Next Plus finds the next page or link and lets you "+" (increment) part of
the URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or basically
any website that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters.
You can use shortcut keys and mouse buttons and it comes with a lot of options.
It's similar to the FireFox URL Flipper extension.
