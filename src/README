urli
____

urli ("yur-lee") is a URL Incrementer that lets you increment or decrement
digits in a URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or
basically any website that keeps its URLS organized sequentially by numbers.
It's similar to the FireFox URL Picker extension, and you can use shortcut
keys and mouse buttons to increment automatically.
