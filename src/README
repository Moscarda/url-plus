urli
____

urli ("yur-lee") is a URL Incrementer that allows you to increment or decrement
digits in a URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or
basically anyt website that keeps its URLS organized sequentially by numbers.
It's similar to the FireFox "URL Picker" extension.

Features:
- Tries to guess what part of the URL you want to increment without you having
  to select it.
- Supports the following operations: Increment, Decrement, Clear, Fast
  Increment, and Fast Decrement.  (Fast allows you to increment or decrement
  instantly without having to enter Setup.)
- Customize and save your own shortcut keys and mouse buttons.
- Increment or decrement by any amount you want.
- Keep or remove leading zero (0) digits.
- A full-blown options page that allows you to enable/disable features, change
  default settings, and even specify your preferred selection algorithm.  More
  options coming in future updates.
- Developed with performance in mind -- if keyboard or mouse button shortcuts
  are enabled, urli only polls your system on the tab you have it enabled it
  on, and stops polling after you clear it.
- Robust algorithm that utilizes the DOM element's selectionStart property, so
  urli will always increment the *exact* part your mouse selected even if the
  selection appears multiple times in the URL.
