URL Next Plus

urli lets you increment or decrement digits in a URL or go to the next or previous link in a series of pages. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or basically any website that keeps its URLS organized sequentially by numbers. It's similar to the FireFox URL Picker extension, and you can use shortcut keys and mouse buttons to increment automatically.
