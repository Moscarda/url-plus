# URL Plus

URL Plus lets you "plus" [+] (increment) any part of the URL and can also try to find the "next" [>] link. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any website that keeps its URLs paginated via links or organized sequentially by numbers or letters.

Set your own keyboard shortcuts and customize a wide variety of options, including alphanumeric/base and custom regular expression support. It's a lightweight extension that is similar to URL Flipper for Firefox and it was developed with care to not require any special permissions from you.

Note: Next/Prev functionality is currently limited, but will be vastly improved in the next release!

(This extension was previously known as "urli, A URL Incrementer")

What's New:
3.3 (July 19 2015)
- Added back internal keyboard shortcuts and mouse buttons
- Plus [+] Minus [-] support for Alphanumeric and Base 2 (Binary) thru Base 36 (Hexatrigesimal)
- Selection customization support including using custom Regular Expressions
- Fixed leading zeros issue where it would forget the number originally had a leading zero (e.g. 09 -> 10)
- Fixed the issue where it would forget its URL/Pattern when you go back to Setup after navigating away
- Plus [+], Minus [-], Next [>], and Prev [<] are now each separate shortcut operations and no longer shared to avoid confusion (Mode is gone)
- Next [>] Prev [<] functionality now only works with quick shortcuts and was removed from UI to avoid confusion with Plus [+] Minus [-]
