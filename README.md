# URL Next Plus

(Formerly, "urli, A URL Incrementer")

URL Next Plus tries to find the "next" [>] link and lets you "plus" [+] any part
of the URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any
website that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers (or letters).
Set your own keyboard shortcuts and customize other aspects. It's similar to the
FireFox URL Flipper extension and it was developed with care to not require any
special permissions from you.
