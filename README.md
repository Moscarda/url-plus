# URL Next Plus

URL Next Plus tries to find the "next" [>] link and lets you "plus" [+] any part
of the URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any
website that keeps its URLs paginated via links or organized sequentially by numbers or letters.
Set your own keyboard shortcuts and customize other options. It's similar to the
FireFox URL Flipper extension and it was developed with care to not require any
special permissions from you.

(This extension was previously known as "urli, A URL Incrementer")
