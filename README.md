# URL Next Plus

(Formerly, "urli, A URL Incrementer")

URL Next Plus tries to find the next page or link and lets you "+" (increment)
part of the URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or
basically any website that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers
(or letters). And you can set your own shortcut keys and other settings.
It's similar to the FireFox URL Flipper extension.
