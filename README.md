# URL Plus

URL Plus lets you "plus" [+] any part of the UR and also tries to find the "next" [>] link. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any website that keeps its URLs paginated via links or organized sequentially by numbers or letters.

Set your own keyboard shortcuts and customize other options. It's a lightweight extension that is similar to URL Flipper for Firefox and it was developed with care to not require any special permissions from you.

(This extension was previously known as "urli, A URL Incrementer")
