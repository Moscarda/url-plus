# URL Plus

URL Plus lets you "plus" [+] any part of the URL and can also try to find the "next" [>] link. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any website that keeps its URLs paginated via links or organized sequentially by numbers or letters.

Set your own keyboard shortcuts and fine-tune a wide variety of options, including alphanumeric/base and custom regular expression support. It's a lightweight extension that is similar to URL Flipper for Firefox and it was developed with care to not require any special permissions from you.

Note: Next [>] Prev [<] functionality is currently very basic but will be vastly improved in an upcoming release.

(This extension was previously known as "urli, A URL Incrementer")

What's New - Version 3.3 (July 19, 2015)

- Added back internal keyboard and mouse button shortcuts
- To avoid confusion, Plus [+], Minus [-], Next [>], and Prev [<] are now each separate shortcut operations and are no longer "shared" together
- Next [>] Prev [<] functionality now only works with quick shortcuts and was removed from UI to avoid confusion with Plus [+] Minus [-] Setup
- Plus [+] Minus [-] Alphanumeric and multi Base support (Base 2 Binary thru Base 36 Hexatrigesimal)
- Plus [+] Minus [-] selection customization support including using custom Regular Expressions
- Fixed leading zeros issue where it would forget a number originally had a leading zero after Plus [+]'ing it (e.g. 09 -> 10)
- Fixed the issue where it would forget its URL/Pattern when you go back to Setup after navigating away

Important Note!: The options had to be reset to make all the changes in this update. My deepest apologies for the inconvenience.
